TFSDR is a SoftwareDefineRadio demodulator for web use.
It is intended as a backend for a java web applet front end.

TFSDR uses the Intel Performance Primitives for calculations, mainly FFT.

Plan to replace with FFTW.

TFSDR uses GNU CgiCC: http://www.gnu.org/software/cgicc/
Your distribution probably has it. On Ubuntu, install libcgicc-dev

Usage
-----

TFSDR is a set of CGIBIN programs that a web frontend can use to get streaming audio from a 
SDR sampler: sdrsession, sdrfeed, sdrtune and sdrwaterfall.

A frontend first calls sdrsession to get a unique session cookie. This cookie must follow all +
request to the other TFSDR backend programs. sdrsession also redirects the caller to sdrfeed which
provides the actual audio stream.
By calling sdrwaterfall a line by line from a waterfall plot is streamed instead of audio.
The frontend can also call sdrtune?LO=newfreq to move the listening frequency.

Place the four binaries into a cgi-bin path on your webserver.
